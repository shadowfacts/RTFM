<h1><span class="mcitem" data-item="ExtraRails:lockingRail"></span>Locking Rail</h1>
The Locking Rail holds the cart on it in place until it receives a redstone signal, at which point it propels the Minecart in the direction it is facing.

<h1><span class="mcitem" data-item="ExtraRails:directionRail"></span>Direction Rail</h1>
The Direction Rail acts like the Golden Rail but it only propels carts in the direction it is facing.

<h1 id="teleporting-rail"><span class="mcitem" data-item="ExtraRails:teleportingRail"></span>Teleporting Rail</h1>
The Teleporting Rail teleports Minecarts on it to the other Teleporting Rail it is connected to.

To link Teleporting Rails, open the GUI by right-clicking on them and use the 3 color selectors to pick a frequency for the rail. Do the same for the other Teleporting Rail and Minecarts will be able to teleport back and forth.

**Note:** If there are more than 2 Teleporting Rails on the same frequency, the destination may be random.
