Large Veins adds incredibly rare, super-massive ore veins to the world.

Large Veins uses a JSON configuration file allowing users or modpack developers to modify the minimum/maximum Y coordinate the large vein can spawn at, the size of the large vein, and the chance the large vein has to spawn (higher number is more rare), and even add their own large veins. More information about the configuration file format can be found [here](/large-veins/config/).
