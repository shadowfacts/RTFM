<h1><span class="mcitem" data-item="waypointcompass:compass"></span>Waypoint Compass</h1>
A compass that allows you to change the position it points to.

<canvas class="recipe crafting" data-input="compass,gold_ingot,compass,gold_ingot,empty,gold_ingot,compass,gold_ingot,compass" data-output="waypointcompass:compass"></canvas>

The compass position can then be set by shift-right-clicking the compass. The coordinates and dimension can be seen in the tooltip:

While the compass is in your hand, a beacon beam will render at the waypoint:

The compass position can be duplicated by crafting another Waypoint Compass and placing an existing Waypoint Compass in the center slot:
